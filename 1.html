            <p>When high school student Peter Parker attended a public exhibition, demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, he was bitten by a spider that had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Making his way home afterward, Peter discovered he had somehow gained the proportionate powers of an arachnid. With his newfound abilities, Parker attempted to cash in on them. In a turn of events following his first wrestling match, Peter's uncle died. Peter soon discovered that with great power comes great responsibility. </p>

            <p>The king of the hi-tech African nation of Wakanda, T'challa inherited the throne after his father T'Chaka, the previous Wakandan king and holder of the Black Panther mantle, was assassinated by the sonic villain Ulysses Klaw. As the new Black Panther, T'Challa defends his people from menaces like Klaw and the barbarian M'baku the Man-Ape and protects the world as an Avenger. His wife is Ororo Munroe, the X-Man Storm. He is the guardian of Wakanda's vast supply of the metal vibranium, which has great destructive potential.</p>
